<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 340.16px" src="img\3a28e0f8147f9d0e.png"></p>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 245.67px" src="img\a2d2a1723820cc87.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Selecting Head office and Room</strong></h2>
<p>You can expand the list of the rooms by using the relative tabs. Selecting a room automatically selects the head office to which it belongs. For every room are displayed:</p>

<li> <strong>Projector icon:</strong> Indicates whether or not there is a projector inside the room based on whether or not the icon is activated.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a room is selected, the upper part of the column is updated with the information relative to the choice just made. </p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Favourites</h2>
<p>Next to the name of each room there is a heart - shaped icon (ü§ç), through which is possible to add the selected room to your <strong>list of favourites</strong>. This latter is displayed as an expandable add-on tab just above the head offices tabs.</p>
<p>A room can be removed from the favourites list by clicking on the cross-shaped button present on the left side of room name.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 302.36px" src="img\db70e895c9c2edc5.png"></p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Second Column: Calendar" duration="1">
        <p>In the foreground, in the second column, there are the current day and date.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 207.87px" src="img\3620dc8ebcf07a63.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Selecting the date</h2>
<p>In this section there is a list of dates. By selecting a specific date, you can see its details. The date format is dd/mm/yyyy followed by the name of the day of the week.</p>
<p>Weeks are seperated from each other by a horizontal line. Saturday and Sunday are slightly darkened in order to give more relevance to working days.</p>
<p>When a date is selected, the upper part of the column is updated with the information relative to the choice just made. </p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Third Column: Schedule" duration="1">

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 226.77px" src="img\7dec2cfaf52afec5.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Selecting a Reservation Slot</h2>
<p>In the central part of the column there is a table with three columns and seven rows whose cells include the start and end time of the <strong>slot</strong>.</p>
<p>Slots with a dark color are <strong>disactivated</strong> and can&#39;t be selected. These slots are being disactivated when they refer to time slots that can&#39;t be booked or to a time period that has passed.</p>
<p>It is possible to select the <strong>active</strong> slots by clicking on them. You notice the selection thanks to a change of color and outline thickness. In order to correctly complete a reservation, it is necessary to <strong>select</strong> a slot in a valid way. </p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Nota: </strong>The <em>validity</em> consists of selecting contiguous slots, i.e. not selecting a slot between two already selected. The <em>validity</em> is also given by respecting the constraints at the top of the column (already indicated above).</p>
</aside>
<aside class="warning"><p><strong>Caution: </strong>In case of violation of the selection validity, an information message will appear at the bottom left with the information necessary for correction. Until the selection is valid, it will not be possible to confirm the reservation.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded><strong>Table Consultation</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>From the table you can also see the reservations. The reservations of other users differ from yours because of the different color.</li>
<li>Hovering the mouse over a reservation will highlight the slots it includes.</li>
<li>Clicking on a reservation opens a dialog contaning the <strong>details</strong> of it. The details consist of:</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: a brief description added by the user at the time of the reservation</li>
<li><strong>Guests list</strong>: list of the e-mails related to the guests of the reservation</li>
<li><strong>Participants list</strong>: list of e-mails related to the guests that have confirm their presence through the confirmation e-mail. </li>

<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 226.77px" src="img\c70438f0683995ed.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Nota: </strong>When a reservation on the table is green it means that it is confirmed, in other words it has reached the minimun number of participants required in order not to be cancelled. </p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 212.79px" src="img\7b414dd4704c2e79.png"></p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Switch Time Slots and Shifts</h2>
<p>It has been introduced and made more visible a switch useful for those who work on shifts (e.g. service desk). We then move on to the display of the shifts that can be booked on the typical eight-hour shifts. The logic remains the same as before: you can, of course, book only future slots and not already booked.</p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Nota:</strong>  This mode is visible only for reservations related to rooms with duration of maximum or equal to 8 hours. It doesn&#39;t appear for the rest. (If you want to try, select Sorint Hall room).</p>

<p>You can add a person to be invited by inserting the <strong>name</strong> and a <strong>valid e-mail address</strong> in the appropriate fields (orange box), and clicking the button &#34;‚úö&#34; present on the right side of the box. Once the invitation is successfully completed, the name and the e-mail can be viewed in a list below.</p>
<p>It is possible to remove the invitation from this list through the button üóë present on the right side. </p>
<p>It is also possible to delete the creator of the reservation from the guests list: in other terms you create reservations on behalf of other colleagues.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Reservation Confirm</h2>
<p>If the reservation is valid and respects all requirements the <strong>Confirm</strong> button is going to be activated, which can be disabled in case of any changes that invalidate the reservation.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Confirmation e-mail</h2>
<p>When a user completes a reservation or is invited by another user, he/she receives an e-mail, to the address indicated by the person who has booked the room, containing the <strong>details</strong> of the reservation and the possibility to <strong>confirm</strong> his/her presence.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 601.70px" src="img\e551ad209818db8.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p><strong>Nota: </strong>Once the <strong>minimum number</strong> of participants has been reached, the reservation is automatically confirmed. </p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Limit of Reservations</h2>
<p>At the bottom of the column there is a message that indicates how many more reservations can be completed.
