# select-guide

`App.vue` calls via router-link these pages:
- `English.vue`
- `Italian.vue`

These files are two views.

The flags buttons in the nav bar are managed in the `App.vue` file. Their icons are saved in the `asset` folder.
The folder `guide` contains all the image files needed for the guide.
